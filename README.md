# protein_pKa

## Objective
- Dedicate to using machine learning techniques to help us analyze a biological problem: find pKa values of proteins.


## Background
- Proteins are built as chains of amino acids.
- There are different types of amino acids and we are interested in their pKa values.
- Acid dissociation constant K<sub>a</sub> is our pKa value. It is commonly used for indicating the strength of an acid.
- There are some common types of amino acids: Arginine (ARG), Aspartic acid (ASP), Cysteine (CYS), Glutamic acid (GLU), Histidine(HIS), Lysine (LYS), Tyrosine (TYR).
- The pKa values of amino acids have their theoretical values, but in reality, these values can vary.

## Progress
- Collected sample data and preprocessed the data; eliminated some irrelevant features.
